# Parallel Development

> How N agents (or developers) build features simultaneously on MicroCoreOS
> without ever touching each other's code — and why this is a structural
> guarantee of the architecture, not a hope.

## The thesis

**In MicroCoreOS, every possible conflict is a plan-time error. Code-time
conflicts are structurally impossible.**

In a traditional framework, even a perfect plan produces merge conflicts,
because features share files by design (the service class, the router, the
models module). Here they cannot:

| Architectural property | What it eliminates |
|---|---|
| 1 file = 1 feature | Two agents never write the same file |
| No cross-feature / cross-domain imports | A change in one feature cannot ripple into another |
| Communication only via event bus | Features integrate through named contracts, not shared code |
| Fractal structure (every plugin has the same skeleton) | Agents need no context about each other's style or layout |
| Self-describing system (`AI_CONTEXT.md` regenerated on boot) | Agents share one source of truth instead of reading each other's code |

The remaining conflicts — two agents given the same route, the same table, the
same feature — are **task-allocation errors**: someone assigned the same work
twice. Task decomposition must respect feature boundaries; the plan is where
that happens.

## The methodology

### Phase 0 — Foundation (serial, before any feature)

The schema and infrastructure are shared contracts, so they are written FIRST
and frozen:

1. **Migrations** (`domains/{domain}/migrations/*.sql`) together with their
   **models** (`domains/{domain}/models/`). One author (human or single agent),
   sequential numbering, `-- depends:` where ordering matters.
2. **Tools**, only if the plan requires new infrastructure. Tools are the one
   legitimate place for shared logic — if two features would need the same
   code, it is either duplicated (small) or promoted to a tool (infrastructure).
3. **Boot once** (`uv run main.py`). This regenerates `AI_CONTEXT.md` with the
   real tables, models and tool interfaces — the ground truth every agent will
   receive.

### Phase 1 — The Plan (the contract)

The plan is the namespace-reservation step. It allocates, per feature, every
name that lives in a global namespace, so nothing is left to improvisation:

- **migrations** (phase 0, listed for traceability, with the tables they own)
- **plugins** — one per feature: name, domain, file, function
- **tools** — only if new infrastructure is needed
- **events** — every published event **with its payload model and fields**, and who consumes it
- **routes** — method + path per endpoint
- **persistence** — which tables each feature reads and writes (`db:`), so the
  black-box contract covers input, output AND storage
- **flows** — end-to-end chains with their happy path, the sad-path decisions
  per link, AND the flow's `durability` (may in-flight events die with the
  process?), so every failure mode and crash point is decided before any code
  exists
- **tests** — every feature ships with its unit test file, every flow with its
  e2e chain test, every idempotent link with its double-delivery test, every
  flow that declares failures with its sad-path test; everything has tests

#### Formal plan format

```yaml
plan:
  domain: orders
  phase_0:
    migrations:
      - file: orders/001_create_orders.sql
        tables: [orders]                    # table ownership is declared here
    models:
      - domains/orders/models/order.py
    tools: []                               # new infra tools, only if needed

  features:
    - plugin: CreateOrderPlugin
      file: domains/orders/plugins/create_order_plugin.py
      function: "Create an order and announce it"
      route: { method: POST, path: /orders }
      db: { writes: [orders], reads: [] }   # persistence contract — only tables this domain owns
      publishes:
        - event: order.created
          model: OrderCreatedPayload        # Pydantic payload model, inline in the plugin
          payload: { id: int, user_id: int, total: float }
      consumes: []
      mocks: [db, event_bus]                # what its test mocks
      test: tests/test_create_order.py

    - plugin: OrderNotifierPlugin
      file: domains/orders/plugins/order_notifier_plugin.py
      function: "Notify the user when an order is created"
      route: null                           # pure consumer, no endpoint
      db: null                              # never touches the database
      publishes:
        - event: order.notified
          model: OrderNotifiedPayload
          payload: { order_id: int, user_id: int }
      consumes:
        - event: order.created
          requires: [id, user_id]           # keys this consumer will read (tolerant reader)
      mocks: [event_bus, logger]
      test: tests/test_order_notifier.py

  flows:
    - name: order-lifecycle
      durability: ephemeral                 # ephemeral | durable — may in-flight events die with the process?
      happy_path: "POST /orders → order.created → OrderNotifierPlugin → order.notified"
      e2e_test: tests/test_order_lifecycle_chain.py   # asserts the chain via /system/traces/tree
      sad_path_test: tests/test_order_lifecycle_dlq.py # mandatory here: a link declares retries
      links:                                # one entry per consumed event in the chain
        - consumes: order.created
          consumer: OrderNotifierPlugin
          retries: 3
          backoff: 1.0
          idempotent: true                  # MANDATORY true when retries > 0 OR the flow is durable
          idempotency_test: tests/test_order_notifier.py::test_on_order_created_delivered_twice
          dlq_watcher: null                 # who observes _dlq.order.created (null = loss accepted)
          atomic_with_db: false             # commit+publish must be atomic? true → outbox
          compensation: null                # compensating event if the chain rolls back (saga)
      rpc_links: []                         # every request() call, each with timeout + on_timeout
```

#### Features are black boxes — the plan is their contract

An agent-written plugin is a black box: nobody reviews its internals, so the
plan must pin down everything observable from outside — the route it serves
(request in, response out), the events it publishes (exact payload fields),
the events it consumes (the keys it reads), and the tables it touches (`db:`).
The feature's unit test proves **that contract**, not the implementation:
mock every injected tool, drive the input, assert the output, the DB effects
on the declared tables, and the published payloads. A feature may only read or
write tables its own domain owns — data crosses domains as events, never as
shared tables.

#### Two failure planes

Every failure in a flow lives on one of two planes, and they are planned
differently:

- **Business failures are facts, not exceptions.** A declined payment or an
  out-of-stock item is caught *inside* the handler and published as an event
  (`payment.declined`), which the plan models like any other event — with a
  payload model, consumers, and its own flow if it triggers reactions. The
  feature's unit test covers these outcomes.
- **Infrastructure failures escape to the bus** — the handler raises, the
  process dies, the DB is down. The bus contract makes these enumerable:
  retries → DLQ → (optionally) compensation. The `links:` checklist is
  where each one is decided, and the flow's `sad_path_test` is where the
  decision is proven.

If a "failure" is a business outcome, model it as an event; never plan
business logic through the DLQ.

#### The three crash points

"What if the process dies?" is not open-ended either. A link crosses exactly
three gaps where a crash has a distinct consequence, and each gap has one
field that decides it:

| Crash point | What happens without a decision | The field that decides it |
|---|---|---|
| Between DB commit and `publish()` | The event never existed — downstream never learns | `atomic_with_db: true` → Transactional Outbox |
| Event in flight, process dies | `in_process` driver loses it silently on restart | flow `durability: durable` → requires a durable driver (`sqlite`, `redis_streams`) |
| Mid-handler crash | Durable transports re-deliver → the handler runs twice | `idempotent: true` + its `idempotency_test` |

Crash *tests* split cleanly between transport and flow: redelivery itself is
proven once, generically, by the transport's kill-and-reboot suite
(`tests/tools/test_sqlite_driver.py`) — no feature ever writes a kill test.
What each flow must prove is its side of the bargain: **idempotency**. The
`idempotency_test` delivers the same envelope twice to the consumer (same
mocks as its unit test, still milliseconds) and asserts the final state and
side effects are those of a single delivery.

#### Sad paths are enumerable, not open-ended

In this architecture the failure modes of a chain are finite, because the bus
contract defines them. Each `links:` entry answers the full checklist **at
plan time**, before a line of code exists:

| Field | The question it answers | What forgetting to answer it costs |
|---|---|---|
| `retries` / `backoff` | How many re-deliveries before giving up? | Transient failures become final |
| `idempotent` | Can the handler run twice safely? | Duplicates on every retry / redelivery |
| `idempotency_test` | Where is the double-delivery proof? | "Idempotent" stays a claim |
| `dlq_watcher` | Who consumes `_dlq.<event>` after final failure? | Silent event loss (`null` makes the loss *explicit and accepted*) |
| `atomic_with_db` | Does losing the event between DB commit and publish break the business? | The case for the Transactional Outbox |
| `compensation` | If a downstream link fails for good, what event undoes the upstream work? | No saga path — partial state forever |

At the flow level, `durability` answers the remaining crash point (may
in-flight events die with the process?), and `sad_path_test` proves the
declared behavior: it forces the consumer to fail (a mock that raises) and
asserts the decided outcome in the causal tree. No new helper is needed —
`_dlq.<event>` is published *inside* the failing delivery's context, so it
appears as a child of the event that failed, and the same `assert_chain`
works: `assert_chain(tree, ["order.created", "_dlq.order.created"])`.

**RPC is a different contract with one failure mode: timeout.** `request()`
calls do not ride the retry/DLQ machinery — the caller blocks for an answer.
Every one of them is declared in `rpc_links`, each answering what the caller
does when no answer comes:

```yaml
rpc_links:
  - request: user.validate
    caller: CreateOrderPlugin
    timeout: 5
    on_timeout: "respond 503 to the client, create nothing"
```

Two failure modes need no per-chain decision because the system already
handles them observably: a subscriber auto-unsubscribed after 5 consecutive
final failures publishes `system.subscriber.dropped` (alerting belongs to a
system-wide watcher, not to each plan), and expired TTLs simply drop delivery.

#### Plan validity rules (mechanically checked before dispatch)

A plan is valid iff:

1. No two features share a `file`, a `route`, or a `plugin` name — and none
   collides with a route or plugin already live in the system.
2. No two migrations declare the same table, and no migration declares a table
   another domain already owns.
3. Every `consumes.event` has at least one `publishes.event` in the plan (or
   already exists in the live system — check `AI_CONTEXT.md` / `/system/events`).
4. Every key in `consumes.requires` exists in the corresponding publisher's
   `payload`.
5. Every feature has a `test`.
6. Every `publishes` entry names its payload `model` — the Pydantic class the
   publisher plugin defines inline (`GET /system/events/schemas` serves the
   resulting catalog).
7. Every flow lists ALL its consumed events as `links`, each with the sad-path
   checklist answered, and ALL its `request()` calls as `rpc_links`, each with
   `timeout` and `on_timeout`.
8. Every flow has an `e2e_test` that triggers the happy path and asserts the
   real causal chain against `/system/traces/tree`. The helper
   `tests/helpers/trace_chains.py` makes it a one-liner:
   `assert_chain(build_tree(bus.get_trace_history()), ["order.created", "order.notified"])`.
9. `idempotent: true` is mandatory where `retries > 0` **or** the flow is
   `durable` (durable transports re-deliver after a crash even with zero
   retries), and every idempotent link names its `idempotency_test`.
10. A non-null `dlq_watcher` resolves to a consumer of `_dlq.<event>` — in the
    plan or already live. A watcher that nothing implements is a dead string.
11. A non-null `compensation` names an event that some feature in the plan
    publishes AND at least one feature consumes — a saga with no undoer is
    partial state with extra steps.
12. Every flow where any link declares `retries > 0`, a `dlq_watcher`, or a
    `compensation` has a `sad_path_test`.
13. A `durable` flow requires a durable transport at deployment
    (`EVENT_BUS_DRIVER=sqlite` or `redis_streams`) — advisory: the validator
    warns when the live driver is `in_process`.
14. Every table in a feature's `db:` contract is owned by that feature's own
    domain (declared in `phase_0` or already present in
    `domains/{domain}/migrations/`). Cross-domain table access is forbidden —
    data crosses domains as events.

These rules are executable, not aspirational: **`POST /system/plan/validate`**
takes the plan (YAML or JSON) and returns `errors` (the plan is invalid) and
`warnings` (advisory, e.g. rule 13). The orchestrator runs it before
dispatching any agent; an invalid plan is a task-allocation error — fix the
plan, never patch it in code.

### Phase 2 — Execution (parallel, all at once)

The **orchestrator agent** receives two artifacts: the **full plan** and the
freshly regenerated **`AI_CONTEXT.md`**. It validates the plan
(`POST /system/plan/validate` against the system booted in phase 0)
and dispatches ALL features in a single wave — one agent per feature, each
producing exactly two files: its plugin and its test. No agent needs to see
another agent's output; the plan already told each one which events it may
publish (with exact payloads) and which it consumes.

Never assign two agents to the same feature — evolution of an existing feature
is one task for one agent, not two.

### Phase 3 — Integration boot (the safety net)

Boot the system with all features merged. The linters verify that reality
matches the rules — advisory by design (they warn, never block; a hard gate
belongs in CI via tests):

- **ArchitectureLinterPlugin** — domain isolation, no hardcoded tool imports,
  no documentation drift.
- **EventContractLinterPlugin** — every key a consumer requires is present in
  every statically known publish site (`GET /system/lint`). It scans plugins
  with AST at boot: `event.payload["k"]` accesses mark **required** keys,
  `event.payload.get("k")` marks optional ones, and every literal `publish()`
  site is checked against them. Findings: `MISSING_KEY` (warning),
  `ORPHAN_PUBLISH` / `ORPHAN_SUBSCRIBE` and non-analyzable sites (info).

Then run the whole suite: every feature brought its tests, so the integration
proof is `uv run -m pytest`.

## Summary

```
Phase 0 (serial)     migrations + models + tools → boot → AI_CONTEXT.md
Phase 1 (contract)   plan = namespace + failure-mode reservation
                     (validated by POST /system/plan/validate)
Phase 2 (parallel)   orchestrator + N agents → 1 plugin + 1 test each
Phase 3 (verify)     boot linters + full test suite
```

Plan assigns → agents execute → linters verify. With those three layers,
"N agents without collisions" is not an aspiration — it is a property of the
system.
